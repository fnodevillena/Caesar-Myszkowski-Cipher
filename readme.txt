
Caesar-Myszkowski cipher is a combination of two cryptographic techniques.
The enhanced Caesar cipher, a type of substitution cipher in which a letter some number of positions
down the alphabet determined by modular arithmetic replaces each letter in the plaintext,
and Myszkowski transposition, a variant form of columnar transposition that requires a keyword with recurrent letters.

Unique Features:
- Uses Graphical User Interface.
- Allows the user to select a file to encipher and decipher.
- Creates a new file in each ciphering process, however, overwrites the old one from the previous process if it does exist
  in the specified directory.     

Notes:
- Does not preserve punctuations, spaces, and digits in the ciphering process.
- Only works if all text is compatible with ASCII.
